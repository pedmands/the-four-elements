						<p>If you see it, it will come. We need as many Witnesses as possible to give validity to what we all feel is happening. Without someone to observe the world around us, many things go unnoticed and therefore are invisible. But their effects are not.</p>
						<p>So, what makes a good Witness? Clear communication, coachability, confidence, and candor. Work on speaking out, be open to criticism, hold your head high, and be completely transparent. <strong>Honesty is our most important virtue as a Witness.</strong></p>

							<h3>2019</h3>
							<p>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads. Before the throne were <strong>seven torches of fire</strong>, which are the seven spirits of God.</p>

							<h3>2020</h3>
							<p>Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with <strong>seven seals</strong>... "Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals."</p>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h3>2022</h3>
							<p>... And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before <strong>the Lamb</strong>, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sang a new song, saying:</p>

							<h3>Spring 2023</h3>
							<p>"Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation, and you have made them a <strong>kingdom</strong> and preists to our God, and they shall reign on the earth." </p>

							<h3>Carlo Acutis</h3>

							<h3>The Modern Revival</h3>
							<p><strong>Resurrection</strong> or <strong>anastasis</strong> is the concept of coming back to life after death. In a number of religions, a dying-and-rising god is a deity which dies and is resurrected. Reincarnation is a similar process hypothesized by other religions, which involves the same person or deity coming back to a body, rather than the same one. Disappearance of a body is another similar, but distinct, belief in some religions.</p>

							<p>With the advent of written records, the earliest known recurrent theme of resurrection was in Egyptian and Canaanite religions, which had cults of dying-and-rising gods such as Osiris and Baal. Ancient Greek religion generally emphasised immortality, but in the mythos a number of men and women were made physically immortal as they were resurrected from the dead.</p>
