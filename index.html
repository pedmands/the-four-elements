						<p>"The Four Elements" is a beginner-friendly <span style="font-weight: 700;">meditation routine</span> that is built around Earth, Water, Fire, and Air—four foundational forces that mirror aspects of our inner experience. Each element highlights a different quality we can tap into for greater balance and awareness.</p>

						<p>If you see it, it will come. We need as many Witnesses as possible to give validity to what we all feel is happening. Without someone to observe the world around us, many things go unnoticed and therefore are invisible. But their effects are not.</p>
						<p>So, what makes a good Witness? Clear communication, coachability, confidence, and candor. Work on speaking out, be open to criticism, hold your head high, and be completely transparent. <strong>Honesty is our most important virtue as a Witness.</strong></p>

							<h3>2016</h3>
							<p>He appeared with <strong>seven stars</strong> in his right hand. And seven lampstands were arranged before Him. He spoke of love, poverty, and faith. We were told the devil may test us, but enduring ten days of tribulation meant being given the <strong>crown of life</strong>.</p>

							<h3>2019</h3>
							<p>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads. Before the throne were <strong>seven torches of fire</strong>, which are the seven spirits of God.</p>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h3>2020</h3>
							<p>Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with <strong>seven seals</strong>... "Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals."</p>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h3>2022</h3>
							<p>... And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before <strong>the Lamb</strong>, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sang a new song, saying:</p>

							<h3>Spring 2023</h3>
							<p>"Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation, and you have made them a <strong>kingdom</strong> and preists to our God, and they shall reign on the earth." </p>

						<div>
							<img src="images/earth.png"/>
							<div class="elem-desc" id="earth">
								<h3 style="font-family: 'Beastly';">Earth</h3>
								<p>Earth represents stability and grounding. By tuning into the solid aspects of your body—the way your feet connect with the floor, the weight of your bones—you cultivate a sense of security and presence. This is the foundation that keeps you steady when life feels chaotic.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div data-panel="panel-2">
						<div>
							<img src="images/water.png" />
							<div class="elem-desc" id="water">
								<h3 style="font-family: 'Beastly';">Water</h3>
								<p>Water embodies flow and adaptability. It encourages you to become aware of the natural rhythms within—your breath, heartbeat, and emotional currents—and to ride those waves rather than resist them. By embracing Water, you learn to move with changes instead of feeling overwhelmed by them.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div data-panel="panel-3">
						<div>
							<img src="images/fire.png" />
							<div class="elem-desc" id="fire">
								<h3 style="font-family: 'Beastly';">Fire</h3>
								<p>Fire stands for energy, passion, and transformation. It’s the spark that propels you to grow, create, and push forward. When focusing on Fire, you tap into your inner warmth, channeling that energy in constructive ways to motivate and inspire yourself.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div data-panel="panel-4">
						<div>
							<img src="images/air.png"/>
							<div class="elem-desc" id="air">
								<h3 style="font-family: 'Beastly';">Air</h3>
								<p>Air symbolizes clarity, freedom, and expansion. By paying attention to each inhale and exhale, you create space in both your mind and body. Air encourages you to let go of mental clutter and focus on the present moment, promoting a sense of lightness and openness.</p>
